# Description

In first year of university, we had a module where we were taught inheritance classes in object orientated programming in Java. We were tasked with an assignment to do with different 3-dimensional objects.

We had to create the parent class (Solid - This was just barebones of any 3D object), and then we had to create multiple child classes (Pyramid, Cube, Sphere) that inherited the properties of the parent solid class. This was tested with the different controller classes - checking for more and more issues thoughout each phase.

# Installation

Go onto Github, find the project and clone the repository.
Afterwards, open bash, locate the destinated file with 'cd', and use git clone on the cloned repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aanassor1/Java-OOP-Inheritance-Class-Fundamental-.git
```

After, create a java product on an IDE that has a package. Put all the downloaded classes under the package and rename the first lines, and then put the input text files into the main project folder. 

Take the one of the input file's file path, and use that as the input argument for CW2Phase3 controller class and run it.
